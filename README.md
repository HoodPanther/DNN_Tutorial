# DNN_Tutorial
A quick tutorial on deep networks using Theano and Keras.

This tutorial requires
* a scientific Python distribution ([Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) is a good one),
* a recent ipython or jupyter package (comes with Anaconda, otherwise ```pip install ipython```,
* Theano (available via ```pip install theano``),
* Keras (available via ```pip install keras```.

If you like git/github, you can download the latest versions of Theano or Keras from github at:
* https://github.com/Theano/Theano
* https://github.com/fchollet/keras

and they can be cloned and then installed by running
```python setup.py develop```
from the cloned folder.
